# How to Use KScan3D to Create 3D Models with Kinect
 
KScan3D is a free software that allows you to use a Microsoft Kinect sensor as a 3D scanner. You can create impressive 3D models for animating or 3D printing using nothing but a standard Xbox Kinect. In this article, I will show you how to use KScan3D to scan an object and export it as a 3D model.

## What You Need
 
- A Microsoft Kinect sensor (either Xbox 360 or Xbox One version)
- A power adapter for the Kinect (if you are using the Xbox 360 version)
- A Windows computer with a USB port
- KScan3D software (you can download it from [here](http://kscan3d.software.informer.com/1.2/))
- An object to scan (preferably something with a matte surface and no reflective or transparent parts)

## Step 1: Preparing Your Object
 
Before you start scanning, you need to prepare your object so that it can be captured by the Kinect sensor. Here are some tips:

- Place your object on a flat surface with enough space around it for you to move the Kinect sensor.
- Make sure there is enough lighting in the room, but avoid direct sunlight or glare.
- If your object has a shiny or glossy surface, you can spray some matte paint or powder on it to reduce reflections.
- If your object has holes or gaps, you can fill them with clay or tape to make them more visible to the sensor.
- If your object has thin or fragile parts, you can support them with wires or sticks to prevent them from moving during scanning.

## Step 2: Setting Up the Kinect
 
Next, you need to connect your Kinect sensor to your computer and launch KScan3D. Here are the steps:

- Plug the power adapter into the Kinect sensor and an outlet.
- Plug the USB cable from the Kinect sensor into your computer.
- Wait for the drivers to install automatically. You should see a green light on the sensor when it is ready.
- Open KScan3D software. You should see a live feed from the sensor on the screen.
- Adjust the position and angle of the sensor so that it can see your object clearly. You can use the zoom and tilt buttons on the software to fine-tune the view.
- Click on the Settings button on the top right corner of the screen and choose your preferences for scanning resolution, mesh quality, alignment mode, etc.

## Step 3: Scanning
 
Now you are ready to scan your object. Here are the steps:

- Click on the Scan button on the top left corner of the screen. You should see a countdown timer and a progress bar on the screen.
- Slowly move the sensor around your object, keeping it at a distance of about 50 cm (20 inches) from it. Try to cover all angles and sides of your object as much as possible.
- You can pause and resume scanning at any time by clicking on the Scan button again.
- You can also delete any unwanted scans by clicking on the Delete button on the bottom right corner of the screen.
- When you are done scanning, click on the Stop button on the top left corner of the screen. You should see a 3D model of your object on the screen.

## Step 4: Post-Scan Cleanup
 
After scanning, you may need to clean up your 3D model to remove any noise, holes, or artifacts. Here are some tools you can use:

- The Crop tool allows you to cut out any unwanted parts of your model by drawing a rectangle around them.
- The Erase tool allows you to erase any unwanted parts of your model by clicking and dragging over them.
- The Fill tool allows you to fill any holes in your model by clicking on them.
- The Smooth tool allows you to smooth out any rough edges or bumps in your 0f148eb4a0
